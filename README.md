# MistryCyber Site (React + Tailwind, built with Vite)

This project is pre-configured for Netlify.

## Quick start (no Terminal required)
1) Sign up at https://github.com (free).
2) Click **New repository** -> name it `mistrycyber-site` -> **Create repository**.
3) On the new repo page, click **"uploading an existing file"** and drag **everything inside** this folder into the GitHub page. Commit the changes.
4) Go to https://app.netlify.com -> **Add new site** -> **Import from Git** -> choose GitHub -> pick your `mistrycyber-site` repo.
5) Leave defaults (we included `netlify.toml`). Click **Deploy**.

Netlify will build and give you a live URL. Add a custom domain later if you want.
